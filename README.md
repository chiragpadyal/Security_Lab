[09/11, 12:03 pm] Anuj: Squid is a Unix-based proxy server that caches Internet content closer to a requestor than its original point of origin. Squid supports caching of many different kinds of Web objects, including those accessed through HTTP and FTP.
[09/11, 12:03 pm] Anuj: A spoofing attack is when a malicious party impersonates another device or 
user on a network in order to launch attacks against network hosts, steal 
data, spread malware or bypass access controls
[09/11, 12:03 pm] Anuj: ACLs (Access Control Lists) allow us to restrict the access to websites, and / or 
monitor the access on a per user basis. Access can be restricted based on day of 
week or time of day, or domain,
[09/11, 12:03 pm] Anuj: ARP is short form of Address Resolution Protocol.This is a protocol that is used to 
resolve IP addresses to MAC (Media Access Control) addresses for transmitting data. 
In an ARP spoofing attack, a malicious party sends spoofed ARP messages across a 
local area network in order to link the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a 
legitimate member of the network.
[09/11, 12:03 pm] Anuj: IP address spoofing is one of the most frequently used spoofing attack 
methods. In an IP address spoofing attack, an attacker sends IP packets 
from a false or “spoofed” source address in order to disguise itself. Denial-ofservice attacks often use IP spoofing to overload networks and devices with 
packets that appear to be from legitimate source IP addresses.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Arpwatch is an open source computer software program that 
helps us to monitor Ethernet traffic activity (like Changing IP and MAC Addresses) on 
the network and maintains a database of ethernet/ip address pairings.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: A firewall is a network security system designed to prevent unauthorized 
access to or from a private network.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Iptables command allows the system administrators to manage incoming and outgoing traffics.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Wireshark is a free application that allows you to capture and view the data traveling back 
and forth on your network, providing the ability to drill down and read the contents of 
each packet – filtered to meet your specific needs. I
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: tcpdump is a common packet analyzer that runs under the command line. 
It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received 
over a network to which the computer is attached tcpdump also gives us a option to save captured 
packets in a file for future analysis
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: hping3 should be used to…
 Traceroute/ping/probe hosts behind a firewall that blocks attempts using the standard 
utilities.
 Perform the idle scan (now implemented in nmap with an easy user interface).
 Test firewalling rules.
 Test IDSes.
 Exploit known vulnerabilties of TCP/IP stacks.
 Networking research.
 Learn TCP/IP (hping was used in networking courses AFAIK).
 Write real applications related to TCP/IP testing and security.
 Automated firewalling tests.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make a 
machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Snort can run in two modes:
 Packet Sniffing
 This mode have no special use, all you can do is just look at the traffic coming at the 
interface.
 Network Intrusion detection
 This mode is the actual use of snort, in this mode snort monitor the traffic and block any 
unwanted traffic using the rules
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Snort is a popular choice for running a network intrusion detection systems or NIDS. It 
monitors the package data sent and received through a specific network interface. NIDS 
can catch threats targeting your system vulnerabilities using signature-based detection and 
protocol analysis technologies
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: IPsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between devices. It helps keep data sent over public networks secure
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for 
backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: IPsec involves two security services:
Authentication Header (AH): This authenticates the sender and it discovers any 
changes in data during transmission.
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): This not only performs authentication 
for the sender but also encrypts the data being sent.
There are two modes of IPsec:
Tunnel Mode: This will take the whole IP packet to form secure communication 
between two places, or gateways.
Transport Mode: This only encapsulates the IP payload (not the entire IP packet 
as in tunnel mode) to ensure a secure channel of communication
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: StrongSwan is basically a keying daemon, which uses the Internet Key Exchange 
protocols (IKEv1 and IKEv2) to establish security associations (SA) between two 
peers.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Hashes are the products of cryptographic algorithms designed to produce a 
string of characters.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Hashing is the procedure of translating a given key into a code.
[09/11, 12:04 pm] Anuj: Sl ka prep chalu karo
