Editing snort configuration files
Type:
sudo vi +45 /etc/snort/snort.conf
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.43.130/24 {NOTE: put your ipaddr here. Remove number
after last point and make it 0. Then put /24 at end}
sudo vi +104 /etc/snort/snort.conf
Following the line at 104, make sure your paths look like this.
var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules
var SO_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/so_rules
var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules
var WHITE_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules/iplists
var BLACK_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules/iplists
sudo vi +545 /etc/snort/snort.conf
UN-comment the 545th line and make it look like this
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
alert icmp any any -> {your ip with subnet} any (msg:”ICMP test”; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
Run Snort test conf. and local rules
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf ^C
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Now, let’s start Snort in IDS mode and tell it to display alerts to the console:
sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
Now, ping from other computer and wait for some time. Snort is in listening mode. TaKe ss
Go to /var/log/snort to see alerts
cd /var/log/snort
